# Face Mask Detection

## Description
This project aims to develop a face mask detection system using computer vision and deep learning. The model classifies images of people wearing masks and not wearing masks.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- TensorFlow, Keras (Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, BatchNormalization, Dense, Flatten)
- Streamlit for deployment
- Jupyter Notebook

## Highlights
- **Training Accuracy:** 99.72%
- **Validation Accuracy:** 91.73%
- Utilized Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image classification.
- Integrated the model using Streamlit for real-time face mask detection.
